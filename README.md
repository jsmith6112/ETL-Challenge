# ETL Project

In this assignment, you will put your ETL skills to the test by migrating data from a cloud MySQL database, hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) to a Salesforce application that you will build. This is a practical, real-world example of data movement.

Although you will be working as a team, each team member should set up their own MySQL database, their own Salesforce environment, migrate their own data, and submit their own Salesforce application and code.

The following outlines what you need to do.

### Before You Begin

1. Be sure that your MySQL database is set up on AWS

2. Ensure that you have created your Salesforce developer account

3. Set up your Trailhead account on Salesforce and connect it to your developer account

## Step 1 - Database Setup

Ensure that your MySQL database has been set up and that the GWSIS objects have been created. Be sure to also load the data tables. We completed these steps as a class during Week 13.

## Step 2 - Salesforce Trails

Complete the following trails on Salesforce to familiarize yourself with the platform:
* Platform Development Basics: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/platform_dev_basics
* Data Modeling: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/modules/data_modeling

## Step 3 - Salesforce Application Setup

You will be utilizing what you have learned up to this point to build a Student Information System on the Salesforce platform. Work with your team to design the architecture for the system.

Include the following tables at minimum:
* Student
* Course
* Class
* Class Participant
* Staff
* Staff Assignment

You may also get creative and utilize some of the standard objects within Salesforce. This is optional.

## Step 4 - Data Movement (ETL)

Develop an ETL process in Python that loads each of the tables in Salesforce from your MySQL database on AWS.

## Submission

To submit your work to BootCampSpot, please do the following:

1. Grant `dwilliams4@2u.com` access to edit your Salesforce application

2. Create a new folder for the ETL project in your homework repository

3. Load your Jupyter Notebook to the folder and push up the changes

4. Submit the link to your repository to BootCampSpot

5. After granting `dwilliams4@2u.com` access to edit your Salesforce application, submit the link to BootCampSpot
